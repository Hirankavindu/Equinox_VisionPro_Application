<h3>Problem And Analysis</h3>
<br><br><br>
<P>
  
> We mainly focus the problems that are in the health care sector which is related to SDG 3. In there we identified two aspects that are available with problems. They are metal health and physical health.<br><br>

> When we consider about metal health sector main problem is limited resources and support for metal patients.<br><br>

> In another side physical health sector have main problem in health tracking, Inside that have following problems :-<br>

> No way to track the current status of the patient body health<br>

> Most of the time, patients forget to take medicine at correct time > No any proper way to motivate to do exercise<br><br>


> When we doing research about our domain and what are the existing solutions for our identified problems, we can mainly realize there are some level of solutions available but for getting those solution users have to use 2 or more separate applications. But in health care sector we mainly focussed user category is patients. So we have to think, using different different applications is not easy to them, that’s why we added those features as well as ​ newly added features to our solution as one application.<br><br>
